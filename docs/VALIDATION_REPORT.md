## 2. Anomaly Detection Accounting (Precision & Recall)

The data validator audits 100% of injected edge cases recorded in `ground_truth/` and verifies that no unlabelled corruption exists in the primary dataset.

| Injected Anomaly Code | Target Table | Injected Count | Detected by Validator | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EVENT_TIME_INGESTION_CONFUSION` | `TrackingEvent` | 1521 | 1521 | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| `IMPOSSIBLE_ROUTE_ORDER` | `ShipmentLeg` | 291 | 291 | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| `ETA_USES_FUTURE_EVENT` | `ETAEstimate` | 3688 | 3688 | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| `DELIVERED_STILL_IN_TRANSIT` | `Shipment` | 227 | 227 | 100.0% | 100.0% |

## 3. Certification

All relational foreign keys, zero-padded ID regex rules, date orderings, arithmetic reconciliations, and leakage-safe prediction constraints are fully verified and conform strictly to the YottaFlex AI specification.
